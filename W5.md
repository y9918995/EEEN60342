# 3.1 Introduction to Power Quality   
LECTURER:   
In this section, we are gong to talk about the power quality in a narrower sense.  
That is without outages and interruptions, which have been elaborated in the previous three sections, dealing with the power system reliability.  
A few fundamental characteristics of power quality are presented first.  
Here, power quality is linked to voltage quality, and major voltage quality variations are classified and described with the aid of examples.  
The power quality introduction ends with a few definitions that are used throughout this section.  
The second topic is relatively general and gives a detailed discussion of various types of voltage variations.  
The steady state variations, namely, voltage regulation, voltage unbalance, under- and over-voltages, as well as voltage flicker, are discussed first.  
And this is followed with the consideration of disturbances such as voltage transience and notching.  
It should be noted that a detailed analysis of voltage sags and harmonics is presented in the remaining four presentations.  
The next topic is discussion of voltage sag characteristics, causes, equivalents sensitive to voltage sags, and international standards related to voltage sags and swells.  
Analytical methods for the assessment of voltage sags are presented next.  
Whilst the closing topic gives the mitigation measures, such as application of distribution static compensator, dynamic voltage installer, distribution unified power flow controller, solid state transformer switch, ferroresonant transformers, etc.  
Harmonics are studied in the last two presentations.  
Mathematical derivation of the harmonics is given first, which is followed by consideration of harmonic sources, measures of harmonic distortion, harmonic sources, and consequences.  
The second presentation considers harmonic resonance and filters.  
Here, parallel and series network resonance are presented first, while consideration of harmonic filters is the last topic in this section.  
To this end, several types of filters, filter design and harmonic system studies are discussed.  
  
# 3.2 Voltage Variations   
## 3.2.1 Introduction to Power Quality   
LECTURER:   
We are starting module Power System Dynamics & Quality Of Supply.  
We are now starting to study Quality of Supply.  
This is the first presentation related to the quality of supply, or power quality area.  
In this presentation, we will give essential features of power quality and define the basic types of variations that aggravate the quality of supply.  
The first question we need to answer is: What is power quality? Firstly, power quality is an issue driven by the end users.  
Secondly, power quality is a collection of various subjects, for example, interruptions, sags, lightning surges, under-voltages, harmonics, switching of capacitors, flicker, and over-voltages.  
We can define power quality in broader or narrower sense Power quality in broader sense encompasses reliability.  
That means interruptions of supplies.  
In narrower sense, it does not include reliability.  
We are have done reliability so far.  
For this reason, we are now going to do power quality in a narrower sense.  
Power quality usually refers to the quality of the voltage supplied by the utility with respect to frequency, voltage magnitude, waveform, and symmetry.  
Because the system has impedance, currents outside the direct control of the utility can adversely affect voltage power quality.  
This is illustratively shown in the figure on this slide.  
A customer generates non-sinusoidal currents that are injected into the network.  
The current flows over the network impedances, and causes voltage distortions.  
The answer to the question, "What is 'Good' Power Quality?" is given on this slide.  
If the voltage has a constant sine wave with fundamental frequency only, is supplied at constant frequency, forms a symmetrical three-phase power system, has a constant RMS value, unchanged over time, is unaffected by load changes, and is reliable - that is energy is available when required - then it is of good quality.  
This slide shows the voltage waveform that we want.  
It is a perfect sine wave.  
The voltage peaks and RMS values are also denoted on this slide.  
However, real life can be very different.  
Three cases of voltage distortions are shown on this slide.  
They are all caused by power electronic contractors which supply the variable speed drives.  
We will come back to these waveforms again.  
We are now going to present essential categories of power quality.  
Power quality variations can be classified as: Firstly, Disturbances.  
These are transients, voltage sags and swells, and interruptions of supply.  
The second category is Steady State Variations.  
These are voltage regulation, voltage unbalance, harmonic distortion, and voltage flicker.  
The second classification of power quality is given on this slide.  
The first group is Long Duration variations.  
These are voltage regulation, voltage unbalance, and harmonic distortion.  
The second group is Short Duration variations.  
These are instantaneous variations which last from 0.5 cycles to 30 cycles.  
Then, momentary variations that last for 30 cycles to 3 seconds.  
And finally, temporary variations, whose length is from 3 seconds to 1 minute.  
Now, we are going to see a few examples of voltage distortions related to disturbances and steady state variations.  
Impulsive and oscillatory transients are shown on this slide.  
Voltage sag and voltage interruption are shown on this slide.  
Voltage sag is when the retained voltage or sag magnitude is between 0.1 per unit and 0.9 per unit.  
Voltage swell is when the voltage is between 1.1 per unit and 1.8 unit for less than 1 minute.  
Interruptions occur when the retained voltage is less than 1%.  
Two types of steady state variations are shown on this slide.  
These are harmonics and over-voltages.  
The harmonics are sine waveforms whose frequency is equal to the integer multiple of the fundamental frequency.  
It should be noted that beside harmonics, there are also interharmonics and sub-harmonics.  
Interharmonics are sine waveforms whose frequencies are not an integer of the fundamental frequencies.  
On the other hand, sub-harmonics are sine waveforms whose frequencies are below fundamental frequency.  
The next two steady-state variations are Voltage Flicker and Regulation.  
Voltage flicker is the modulation in the RMS value of the fundamental frequency voltage, and it is typically in the range - 1 to 25 Hertz.  
This is shown on the figure on the this slide.  
Flicker causes visible changes in brightness of a lamp due to rapid fluctuations in the voltage of the power supply.  
And flicker is very irritating visual sensation, and must be eliminated for health and safety reasons.  
On the other hand, voltage regulation is, for example, change of voltage RMS over the length of a distribution feeder.  
It can result into long-term under- and over-voltages.  
An Illustration of different Power Quality categories is presented on this slide.  
Please, go through the individual categories on your own.  
This is a very good illustrative representation.  
We will come back to the disturbances and steady-state variations in the next presentation.  
We are now going to present three definitions that are used in the rest of our presentations.  
The first is the 'Root Mean Square' or RMS.  
It is given by the well-known formula presented on this slide.  
Please, note that discrete form of the formula, which is used when samples of discrete values are available.  
The second definition is related to the 'Short Circuit Ratio' or SCR.  
SCR is the ratio of the short-circuit current at a bus, ISC, and the nominal current of the circuit, or transformer, Inom.  
Instead of nominal current, maximum loading current is sometimes used.  
The short-circuit current is often limited by the distribution transformer when the customer connection is at the transformer secondary.  
In such cases, the SCR is estimated as the inverse of the transformer per unit reactance.  
Finally, the last definition is Short Circuit Capability in MVA or per unit, and it is presented on this slide.  
The SCC formula is derived from the basic expression, that SCC is equal to the square root of 3, times short-circuit current, times nominal voltage.  
Then, from the basic expression for SCC, the formula presented on this slide is derived.  
Here, the source impedance is used to model the non-model upstream part of the network.  
And this completes the presentation of this subsection.  
  
## 3.2.2 Voltage Variations   
LECTURER:   
We'll do module power system dynamics and quality of supply.  
We have done so far introduction into power quality.  
We are continuing with analysis of the power quality area.  
In this presentation we are going to talk about different types of voltage variations.  
In the first instance we will classify the voltage variations in several groups.  
We have already presented this slide in the previous presentation.  
Steady state variations are voltage regulation, voltage unbalance, voltage flicker and harmonic distortion.  
On the other hand disturbances are voltage transients, interruptions of supply and outages and voltage sags and swells.  
We will consider voltage regulation first.  
definition of voltage regulation is given on the slide.  
It is in fact one minus relative voltage drop or voltage rise.  
The regulation of voltage is closely related to the strength of the bus.  
That is the ability of the bus to supply current without changing voltage amplitude, A well known derivation of the voltage drop across system impedance is shown on the slide.  
Apparent power P + jq is specified a resource node whose voltage is a weak one.  
The complex load current I can then be calculated for apparent power P + jq and voltage V1.  
The voltage drop is complex impedance z times load complex current I.  
The voltage drop DV is very often simplified in the following way.  
Firstly the first term delta V is only used.  
Secondly we often use Dv equals relative power q times reactance X divided by normal voltage where resistances are much smaller than the reactances.  
Several principles to improve voltage are shown on the slide.  
Firstly we can add shunt capacitor to reduce relative current.  
The change in voltage drop is given by the equation below.  
Secondly we can add series capacitor to counter voltage drop X times I.  
Then change in voltage drop is given by the second equation.  
We can also add voltage regulators to boost voltage on 11kV and 0.4kV.  
We can use tap changing transformers and we can add a static VAR systems.  
Addition of a shunt or a series capacitor is shown on the slide.  
In case of a shunt capacitor voltage change due to capacitor connection is delta v equals X transformer times Q capacitor divided by Vm.  
This expression is further developed below.  
Similar effects is obtained a well connecting series capacitor.  
The size of capacitor can be determined for the existing power vector and the new power vector that needs to be achieved.  
This is shown on the right hand side of the slide.  
Distribution network tap changers are in other means to control voltage in distribution networks.  
We are studying tap changer at the beginning of radial networks which are 11kV and 6.6kV in the UK.  
Principle of operation of an on-load-tap-changer is automatic voltage relay measures voltage on secondary sides and gives input to the motor the exchanges primary taps up and down.  
AVR set point can be set in one of the following two ways, firstly only voltage measurement is used and AVR set point can be say 105%.  
This is shown on the figure on the left hand side.  
Please note the major drawback.  
During low load hours the voltage is too high even towards the end of the feeder.  
The second possibility is to activate so called line drop compensation.  
In this case every AVR set-point is the sum of the voltage measurement and an impedance times measured current (INAUDIBLE) Please note that the voltage profile during low load hours is much better.  
An example of power factor correction is presented on this slide.  
An industrial 80 MVA transformer with X equals 12% is supplying a 50MVA load whose power vector is 0.9.  
A shunt capacitor bank should be used to increase the power vector to 0.95.  
Find the size of the capacitor and the voltage rise knowing that the short circuit capacity level at the 300kV bus is 2000MVA.  
Solution of the problem is as follows.  
Based on the SCC of 2000 MVA which is 20 per unit or 100 MVA base.  
We can calculate that the upstream system reactance Xs which is 0.05 per unit.  
Then the total reactance x22 is equal to the sum of the system and transformer reactances which amounts to 0.2 per unit.  
The active load is 0.45 per unit.  
We can determine the required size of the capacitor bank from the existing and target power vectors.  
We are getting qc is equal to 7mv and capacitor reactance Xc is 14.3 per unit.  
Voltage improvement can be determined from the total reactance x22 and capacitor MV Ar rating Qc.  
It is equal to 1.4%.  
The next category of voltage variations is voltage unbalance.  
voltage imbalance is a condition in which the three phase voltage differ in magnitude, are displaced from their normal 120-degree phase relationship or both.  
In this context magnitude unbalance is the maximum deviation among the three phases from the average three phase voltage divided by the average of these three phase voltages.  
Then phase-angle unbalance is the maximum deviation of the angular difference between the three phases divided by 120 degrees.  
Finally, it is useful to define the negative or zero sequence unbalance ratio.  
This is the ratio of the negative or zero sequence component to the positive sequence component.  
Causes of voltage unbalances are shown on this slide.  
These are single phase loads on a three-phase circuit.  
Next, blown fuses in one phase of a three-phase capacitor bank.  
Then, single phase faults.  
And single phase generation.  
One example of negative effect of voltage unbalance is increased heating of motors.  
Voltage unbalance is defined through the ratio, of the negative and the positive voltage components: V2 over V1.  
The International power quality standard EN 50160 defines this limit equal to 2%.  
A curve - motor directive factor versus voltage unbalance percentage is shown on this slides.  
We can see that the rating of 0.95 is recommended, even for the ratio of 2%.  
We are now going to define overvoltages and undervoltages.  
Overvoltage is an increase in the RMS value of voltage above 110% for more than one minute.  
Main causes of overvoltages are - load switching, incorrect tap settings on transformers and the system is too weak for the desired voltage regulation or voltage controls are inadequate.  
On the other hand, undervoltage is a decrease in the RMS value of voltage below 90% for more than one minute.  
Main causes of undervoltages are - load switching, incorrect tap settings on transformers and overloaded systems.  
We are now going to discuss voltage flicker.  
Voltage flicker is the modulation in the RMS value of the fundamental frequency voltage component, which is typically in the range 1-25Hz.  
The most sensitive is 8-10Hz.  
Voltage Flicker gives impression of unsteadiness of visual sensation induced by a light stimulus whose spectral distribution fluctuates with time.  
The magnitude of voltage is usually within the voltage range of 0.9 per unit until 1.1 per unit.  
Finally, the main causes of the loads with continuous, rapid variations in the load current magnitude such as Arc furnaces, embedded generation and welding.  
Different sources of Voltage Flicker are shown in the table on this slide.  
Besides, there are other sources - for example, 175Hz inter-harmonics may also cause flicker.  
Induction furnaces and wind generators can be also sources of inter-harmonics.  
Flicker severity measurement is relatively complicated because human perception, has to be taken into account.  
Flicker severity is measured with the aid of the so called flickermeter.  
IEC has published design specifications for flickermeter.  
Flickermeter has two main parts.  
The first is electrical model of the lamp-eye-brain chain, giving flicker sensation through the instantaneous flicker level IFL.  
The second is on-line statistical processing of the IFL, giving short-term flicker perceptibility or severity index Pst in 10-minute intervals.  
Pst is a per-unit quantity where one per unit represents a flicker severity that corresponds to perceptible flicker in 60 Watt incandescent lights.  
Long-term flicker severity index Plt is calculated from 12 successive Pst values over a 2-hour period using the given formula.  
The main features of Flickers are summarised in this slide.  
Flickers are caused by variable loads or generations.  
We have to be aware of loads that generate inter-harmonics.  
There is a standardised monitoring approach.  
Most annoying frequencies are between 8 and 10 Hz.  
And mitigation is done using the flicker compensator.  
We will say a few words about interruptions and outages now.  
Interruptions and outages were extensively elaborated, within availability analysis.  
In that respect, we will only talk about the classification, of interruptions and outages.  
We can classify supply interruptions by the duration of interruptions.  
There are two categories.  
Long interruption is a decrease in the RMS voltage to less than 0.1 per unit for a duration in excess of one minute.  
The total loss of supply is restored by manual restoration of supply.  
Short interruption is a decrease in the RMS voltage to less than 0.1 per unit for a duration not exceeding one minute.  
The total loss of supply is followed by automatic or remote restoration of supply.  
Please note that the classification in the UK is somewhat different.  
Interruptions longer than three minutes are recorded, and considered by the regulator, in the quality of supply incentive mechanism, which rewards good performance, and penalises bad performance.  
Interruptions shorter than three minutes are only recorded, but not taken into account by the regulator, within the incentive mechanism.  
Types of outages and interruptions are summarised on the slide.  
Outages can be permanent, temporary and transient.  
Permanent outages are damaged faults that require repair or replacement.  
Temporary outages are undamaged faults that are restored by manual switching or fuse replacement.  
Finally, transient outages are undamaged faults that are restored automatically.  
Interruptions can be either momentary or short and sustained or long.  
Momentary interruptions last less than one minute, usually are not recorded in fault statistics and are caused by transient faults and switching.  
Sustained interruptions last longer than one minute.  
They are generally recorded in fault statistics and are caused by permanent and temporary faults.  
System reliability indices are defined in the reliability analysis section at three levels.  
Load-generation systems.  
Composite generation-transmission systems and Distributed systems.  
We are not going to about them again.  
The next category of voltage variations are voltage transients.  
Voltage transients can be classified as impulsive transients and oscillatory transients.  
And impulsive transient is defined as a sudden, non-power frequency change in the steady state condition of the waveform of voltage, current or both that is unidirectional in polarity.  
That is either positive or negative, And oscillatory transient is a sudden, non-power frequency change in the steady-state condition of the waveform of voltage, current or both that includes both positive and negative polarity values.  
An example of both impulsive and oscillatory transients is shown on this slide.  
Transients are characterised by peak voltage, duration, rates-of rise, energy content and frequency in case there are oscillations.  
Several causes of voltage transients are stated on this slide.  
These are; capacitor bank energising.  
Capacitor and DG interaction.  
Back-to-back capacitor energising.  
Adjustable speed drives and electronics loads.  
Lightning, Cable switching and Ferroresonance.  
Ferroresonance occurs when there is magnetising reactance of the transformer connected in series with cable capacitors or power factor capacitor.  
In real life, ferroresonance can happen during manual switching of unloaded or lightly loaded cable-fed transformers with one or two open phases.  
We will now look into the causes voltage transients one by one.  
Capacitor energising is shown on this slide.  
There is a series connection of inductor cell and capacitor C.  
Resonance frequency f node is obtained reactors XL is equal to reactors Xc which give the very known formula give on the right-hand side.  
If you connect three series of voltage transients for capacitor energising are listed on this slide.  
Firstly, frequency is usually less than 1kHz and last 0.5 to 3.0 cycles.  
Secondly, maximum possible peak is twice system peak voltage.  
In practise, maximum peak is usually about 1.4 per unit.  
Next voltage transient will pass through distribution transformer by nearly the related to transformer turns ratio.  
And voltage rise of about 2-3% is common when typical capacitor bank is energised.  
The next cause is the capacitor and DG interaction.  
For example, utility capacitor switching can kick DGs off.  
On the other hand, varying DG production can cause excessive capacitor switching.  
That can be a phenomenon called self oxidation.  
This means that any induction generators suddenly isolated on a capacitor bank can continue to generate for some time resulting in unregulated voltage.  
Next, switching local capacitor to regulate voltage and reactive power may yield resonance with frequency that coincides with harmonics produced in the same facility.  
Several solutions to this problem can be developed.  
For example, block utility capacitor while DG is operating.  
Or change tap on DG service transformer.  
Or increase capacitor control band or switch to a different type of control.  
The third cause of voltage transients is switching in the second capacitor when the first capacitor has been already switched in.  
This is called back-to-back capacitor switching.  
The resonance frequency is obtained in the same way as before.  
We need to use equivalent inductance and equivalent capacitors C and to plug them in the formula for calculation of the resonant frequency.  
Resonant frequency is usually below 10 kHz and maximum possible peak can reach two per unit.  
The major consequence of these transient overvoltages is that they can cause misoperation of electronic power conversion devices which typically have withstand capability of 1.75 per unit voltage.  
Impact of the capacitor energising on adjustable speed drives is shown on this slide.  
The ASD is shown in the middle part of the slide.  
And AC motor is supplied from a power electronics convertor that consist of a rectifier DC capacitors and invertor.  
The voltage and input current waveforms before and after capacitor energising as shown in the top part of the slide.  
Just after the capacitor energising, there are oscillatory voltages and input current transients.  
Those insulation are presented on this slide.  
Add reactance on the front end of the drive or built it into the DC link.  
This reactance is often called choke.  
And the second solution can be the motor is constructed with first few turns with the better insulation.  
Transient overvoltages can occur during the lightning strikes or just after switching on transmission or distribution networks.  
A few features I presented on this slide.  
The last category of voltage transient is voltage notching.  
Voltage notching is a disturbance of the normal power voltage waveform, lasting less than half-cycle, which is initially of opposite polarity than the waveform and is thus subtractive from the normal waveform in the terms of the peak value of the disturbance voltage.  
This is shown in the figure below.  
Solution to voltage notching is addition of a reactance or isolation transformer on the input to the drive.  
And this completes the presentation of this subsection.  
  
# 3.3 Voltage Sags   
## 3.3.1 Voltage Sags: Characteristics and Causes   
LECTURER:   
We are doing module power system dynamics and quality of supply.  
So far, we have done introduction to power quality and voltage variations.  
We are continuing to study power quality aspects.  
In this presentation and in the next one, we are going to talk about voltage sags or voltage swells.  
Our first task is to define voltage sags and present characteristics of voltage sags.  
Voltage sag is the decrease in the RMA ac voltage, at the power frequency, of duration from 0.5 cycles to 2-3 seconds.  
An example of a voltage sag is shown in the figure on this slide.  
Classification of RMA voltage disturbances using voltage magnitude and its duration shown in the table on this slide.  
The table is taken from IEEE standard 1159 recommended practice monitoring electric power quality.  
We can see that shown duration variations are classified as instantaneous, momentary and temporary.  
On the other hand, long duration variations are classified as sustained interruptions under voltages and over voltages.  
We will define the following voltage sag characteristics.  
Sag magnitude, sag duration, phase angle jump or phase shift, point on the wave of voltage reduction and restoration, and asymmetry of voltage reduction in three phases.  
So, let's start with voltage sag definitions.  
Firstly, voltage sag magnitude is the remaining RMS voltage in percent or per-unit of the pre-fault voltage during the event.  
Know that in the case of the non-rectangular sag, the sag magnitude is a function of time.  
Next, voltage drop is the difference between the pre-event RMS voltage and the RMS voltage during the event.  
Finally, voltage sag duration is the duration of the RMS reduction of the voltage sag.  
In other words, it is the persistent time that the voltage of the phase with the lowest magnitude is lower than 0.9 per-unit of the nominal voltage.  
An illustration of voltage sag duration, voltage drop and sag magnitude is shown in the figure on this slide.  
Please note that the diagram shows variation of the RMS value over time.  
And not temporal variation of the waveform.  
The slide also gives the definition of voltage swell.  
An illustration of voltage sag in time domain is shown on this slide.  
The sag characteristics are the magnitude of sag is 50% and it is a single phase sag.  
The sag is initiated at 180 degrees on the wave.  
Which is marked with a green dots.  
The sag last for 100 ms, or 5 full periods.  
Please, note the differences in voltage RMS values when different calculations windows are being used.  
Brown curve is when the window is half a cycle.  
And the red curve is when the window is one cycle.  
Three more sag definitions are presented on this slide.  
Point on the wave of sag initiation is the phase angle of the voltage at the moment the voltage waveform shows a significant drop compared to its normal waveform.  
Note that the phase angle is measured with respect to the last upward zero-crossing of the voltage waveform.  
Next, point on wave of sag recovery is the phase angle of the voltage at the moment the voltage waveform shows a significant recovery.  
And non-rectangular sag is a voltage sag where the sag magnitude versus time is not constant.  
Two examples of temporal variation of voltage sags are shown on this slide.  
The first voltage sag has the following characteristics.  
Retained voltage is 10%, and sag magnitude is 90%.  
The sag is initiated at 180 degrees point on the wave.  
Which is shown with the green arrow.  
The sag duration is 100 ms.  
The second sag is initiated at 90 degree point on the wave.  
Other characteristics are the same as for the first sag.  
Please, note again differences in voltage RMS values when different calculation windows are used.  
The next three sag characteristics are shown on this slide.  
Voltage unbalance is a condition in which the three phase voltages differ in magnitude, or are displaced from their normal 120 degree phase relationship, or both.  
Magnitude unbalance is the maximum deviation among the three phases from the average of the three phase voltages divided by the average of the three phase voltages.  
And phase-angle unbalance is the maximum deviation of the angular difference between the three phases divided by 120 degrees.  
Temporal variation and RMS variations of a voltage sag are shown on this slide.  
The characteristics of the voltage sag are it is a three phase sag.  
The retained voltage of red phase is 75%, of brown phase is 50%, and for blue phase it is 25%.  
The point of initiation on brown phase is 90 degree on the wave.  
It is different for the two other phases.  
The RMS values during voltage sag are shown on the right hand side.  
The next three characteristics of voltage sags are presented on this slide.  
Negative or zero sequence unbalance ratio is the ratio of the negative or zero sequence component to the positive sequence component.  
Next, missing voltage is the difference between the actual voltage during the event and the voltage as it would have been if the event had not taken place.  
And complex missing voltage is a complex number which represents the missing voltage of a voltage sag in one phase.  
It is the difference in the complex plane between the pre-event voltage and the voltage during the sag.  
Graphical explanation of the missing voltage is shown on this slide.  
Voltage sag is initiated at minus 60 degrees or 300 degree point on the waveform.  
And it lasts for about 120ms.  
This is shown in the first figure.  
The full voltage without voltage sag is shown in the second figure.  
And the missing voltage in the third figure.  
The missing voltage is obtained by subtracting the first figure from the second figure.  
The last sag characteristic is phase angle jump, or shift.  
Phase angle jump, or shift, is difference in voltage phase-angle between the pre-event voltage and the voltage during the sag.  
These two voltages are measured in zero minus, which is a pre-event and zero plus.  
Which is the event initiation.  
It is the displacement in time of the during event voltage waveform relative to the pre-event waveform.  
A positive phase-angle shift indicates that the phase-angle of the during event voltage waveform leads the pre-event waveform.  
Two single phase voltage sags are shown on this slide.  
The common features are that the retained voltages are 50%.  
And that their duration is 100ms.  
The blue voltage sag is initiated at 90 degrees point on the waveform.  
And there is no phase jump.  
The red voltage sag is initiated at 45 degrees point on the waveform.  
And there is a phase shift of minus 60 degrees.  
Note that the during event voltage wave starts here at minus 15 degrees.  
We are now going to talk about causes of voltage sags, equipment sensitivity and standards.  
The most frequent causes of voltage sags are shown on this slide.  
Firstly, the power system faults.  
The most common are line to ground faults.  
Ground faults were the most sever three phase faults.  
Next, starting of large induction motors can cause voltage sags.  
Then, transformer energising also can generate voltage sags.  
And finally, large load changes can lead to voltage sags as well.  
Voltage sags are influenced by the following factors.  
System grounding, fault impedance and location, configuration of the power system, transformer connections, System protection practices, and load connections.  
When going through transformers, voltage sags can be shifted.  
Which depends on the connection of transformer windings.  
This slide presents propagation of a voltage sag to transformers shown on the left hand side of the slide.  
Temporal variations of 480 volts voltage in phases AB, BC and CA are shown in the figure.  
The first fault is a single phase fault of phase A at 115kV.  
We can see there is a major distortion of phase AB voltage at 480 volts.  
But not CA.  
The second fault is a single phase fault of phase A at 138kV.  
There is a major distortion of both AB and CA voltages at 480 volts.  
Equipment which is susceptible to voltage sags is listed in this slide.  
In case of low power equipment the devices are computers, programmable logic controllers, variable speed drive control, tension control, IT and robotic controls.  
In case of high power equipment, some of the devices susceptible to voltage sags are a variable speed drives, motors, tension actuators, robotic equipments and contactors.  
An example of equipment sensitive to voltage sags is shown on this slide.  
The relevant voltage limits in percent.  
And critical durations in milliseconds are shown in individual fields.  
In this table, a rectangular voltage tolerance curve was assumed.  
Compute Business Equipment Manufacturers Association or CBEMA has originally developed the voltage tolerance envelopes.  
Which are shown on the slide.  
The region above the upper limit is prohibited region whereas the region below lower limit is no damage region.  
This curve was later updated by the Information Technology Industry Council.  
Both voltage tolerance envelopes apply to single phase equipment operating at 120 volts.  
Both voltage tolerance curves are presented in IEEE standard 446.  
The Information Technology Industry Council has updated the CBEMA diagram.  
Which is shown on this slide.  
The major difference with respect to CBEMA curve is the lower limit curve.  
Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International has published right through capability curve for semiconductors equipment in 1998.  
This curve is shown on the slide.  
The voltage sag should be above this curve.  
Comparison of CBEMA, ITIC, and SEMIF standards is shown on this slide.  
All curves represent lower limits of the voltage tolerance envelopes.  
And this concludes the presentation in this sub-section.  
  
## 3.3.2 Voltage Sags: Assessment and Propagation   
LECTURER:   
We are doing module power system dynamics and quality of supply.  
So far, we have done introduction to power quality, voltage variations, and voltage sag definitions and characteristics.  
We are continuing with analysis of power quality.  
In this presentation, we are going to talk about two aspects.  
Firstly, assessment of voltage sags.  
And secondly, voltage sag propagation.  
Voltage sags can be assessed by using one of the following methods.  
Measurements, analytical techniques, and combination of measurements and analytical techniques.  
In this presentation, we'll be focused on analytical techniques.  
In this example, we will show simple calculation of a post-fault regime following a three phase fault.  
This means that we will need only positive sequence network at each parameters.  
The problem is as follows.  
The customer is connected at a 12Kv busbar that feeds Several; radial feeders: It's pre-fault voltage is 1.0 per unit.  
A 3 phase fault occurs on one of the radial feeders at the location whose electrical distance to the 12Kv busbar is 1.39 per unit.  
Find the post-fault voltage at the 12Kv busbar given that the system reactance is 0.5 per unit on a 100 MVA base.  
The positive sequence equivalent scheme contains the voltage source and two impedances namely source impedance Zs and fault impedance Zf.  
This means that the voltage at 12kV busbar is calculated using the so-called voltage divider.  
This means that the voltage V customer is equal to V source times Z fault divided by Z fault plus Z source.  
Which gives 0.735 per-unit.  
This is shown on this slide.  
In this and the following three slides, we are going to present calculation of the most important sag characteristic.  
The considered problem is as follows.  
A customer is connected at transformer secondary side.  
As shown in the figure.  
A 3-phase fault occurs at an outgoing circuit whose electrical distance to the busbar is 0.7 plus J 1.3 per unit.  
Find the post fault voltage sag magnitude and phase angle shift at the customer busbar.  
repeat the calculation when the electrical distance is 0.8 plus j0.4 per unit.  
Please, note that the apparent power S equal to 0.6 plus j0.2 per-unit is given at the source node.  
Whose voltage Vs is constant and equal to 0.98 per-unit.  
The diagram of the network is repeated on this slide for convenience.  
We will assume that the source voltage Vs is along the real axis.  
So, that it's angle is 0 degrees.  
The equivalent impedance Zs between the source and the customer busbar is transformer impedance Zt plus parallel connection of line 1 and line 2 impedances.  
Whereas the load current can be calculated from apparent power S and source voltage Vs.  
The pre-fault voltage Vc pre-fault is then calculated by subtracting the voltage drop from the source voltage Vs.  
This gives 0.92 per-unit and angle of minus 12.12 degrees.  
The corresponding phase in the compass plane is denoted as VCPF.  
Now, we need to calculate the post-fault regime and find voltage Vc fault.  
Post-fault voltage Vc fault is calculated in the same way as in the previous example.  
We can use the expression for voltage divider.  
We are getting that Vc fault is equal to 0.8 per-unit with the angle of minus 4.4 degrees.  
This means that the phase-angle jump is equal to theta C fault minus theta C pre fault.  
Which gives 7.72 degrees.  
The phasor diagrams is shown on the right hand side.  
The post-fault voltage of Vc fault is between phasors Vs and pre-fault voltage VCPF.  
If we apply different fault impedance equal to 0.8 plus j0.4 per-unit.  
We will get the that post-fault voltage at customer busbar's Vc fault is equal to 0.79 per-unit.  
With angle of minus 15.3 degrees.  
This gives the phase angle jump of minus 3.2 degrees.  
The corresponding phasor diagram is shown on the right hand side.  
The post-fault voltage Vc fault is now below the pre-fault voltage VCPF.  
Prediction of potential voltage sags is briefly discussed in this slide.  
One of the most frequent causes is lightning.  
Lightning faults per km of line per year can be predicted by utilising geometry of transmission lines, parameters of the insulators and ground flash density.  
The effects of fault on plant equipment depend on the sag characteristics.  
Which are influenced by fault clearing time, fault impedance and location, configuration of the network and the system protection design.  
The area of vulnerability can be defined for a particular customer and the likelihood of a fault within this area can be calculated.  
An example of the area of vulnerability is shown on this slide.  
The higher sensitivity of certain loads will cause these loads to be affected by faults further away on the power network.  
If the area of vulnerability can be determined through computer calculations, then the enclosed line sections can be analysed for their expected lightning performance.  
The lightning performance analysis can determine the expected number of lightning-induced faults by year per mile of line.  
An expected number of voltage sags per year that caused a particular agreement to trip can then be determined.  
Sag propagation is briefly presented on this slide.  
The sag propagation is approximately inverse to the fault levels at the buses on the direct path.  
For example: If a bus on a direct path has a fault level 10 times that at the point of fault, then the sag at that bus will be approximately 10 percent.  
Now, we are going to talk about the mitigation measures for voltage sags.  
Mitigation measures can be classified as either a reduction in the number of faults or voltage profile improvements.  
Reduction in a number of faults on a transmission network can be done by applying the following remedies.  
Adjusting transmission tower footing resistance.  
Installing line arresters.  
Regular insulator washing.  
Installing fast switches with instantaneous protection.  
Arc-suppression coil earthing with time grading protection.  
This is used extensively in Europe and gives typical reduction in faults of 10 percent.  
Reduction in a number of faults on a distribution network can be done by applying the following remedies.  
Network Automation at 11KV and low voltage.  
Regular tree trimming.  
Installing animal guards.  
And anti-climbing devices.  
Installing arresters.  
Building network loops, instead of radial networks.  
And modify feeder design, such as covered overhead conductors.  
The second category, was improving voltage profiles.  
The following can be done at a utility level.  
Faster protection.  
More Meshes in the network, where it is possible.  
Installation of Facts devices such as: Distibution static compensator.  
Dynamic voltage restorer.  
Distribution unified power flow controller.  
Solid state transfer switch.  
Fault limiting reactors.  
Following devices are often used at individual distribution feeders at customer interface points.  
Distribution STATCOM.  
Dynamic voltage restorer.  
Distribution unified power flow controller.  
Solid state transfer switches.  
Electronic tap-changer.  
Private generation.  
Motor, generator sets.  
Uninterruptible power supply.  
Constant voltage transfomers.  
Finally, voltage profiles can be improved at the customer's premises.  
For example, following remedies can be applied.  
Advanced capacitors for fault ride through.  
Improved variable speed drives.  
Improved motor starters using either DC supplies or lower drop-out.  
Customer systems designed for sag tolerance.  
We will be now talking about devices for improving voltage profile until the end of this presentation.  
The first set of devices is shown on this slide.  
These are Distribution static compensators.  
Dynamic voltage restorers.  
Unified power flow controllers.  
Solid state breakers at dual feeders, capable of switching load from one feeder to the other.  
Solid state series compensators.  
Application of a DSTATCOM as a parallel or shunt conditioner is shown on these slides.  
This is a shunt reactive power source, close to the load.  
Components of a DSTATCOM are: coupling inductance, IGBT converter, DC capacitor.  
DCSTATSCOM is a current source.  
DSTATCOMs are good for fluctuating loads to eliminate flicker or harmonics.  
The network in the figure is modelled via Thevenin source, Vth and Thevenin impedance, Zth.  
Current I injected by the DSTATCOM is driven by the converter voltage V2.  
Converter voltage V2 can be found from the two equations presented on the right-hand side.  
Then, converter current I can also be calculated.  
The major limitations of DSTATCOMs are shown on this slide.  
DSTATCOMs are shunt devices whose effect is dependant on network source impedance.  
DSTATCOMs provide support to load busbar and nearby network.  
DSTATCOMs provide reactive power only.  
And robust control systems are required.  
The next device is Dynamic Voltage Restorer.  
DVR is a series power conditioner.  
DVR is, in fact, a voltage source inserted with the load.  
The main components of a DVR are: rectifier, DC capacitor, inverter and coupling transformer.  
The main principle is that the DVR supplies missing voltage during voltage sags, or corrects for harmonic distortion.  
A DVR can have energy storage connected to it.  
A schematic representation is given on this slide.  
Energy storage is connected at the DC terminal of an inverter whose AC side supplies the coupling transformer linked in series with the loads.  
Required injected voltage can be found from the equation given on this slide.  
Essential characteristics of dynamic voltage restorers are shown on this and the next slides.  
Voltage vector added in series with supply to control load voltage.  
Reactive support possible on all phases.  
Real power from energy storage or from un-faulted phases.  
DVRs Implemented on a number of semiconductor fabrication plants and paper mills.  
Lower rated devices may be used which will reduce the cost of DVRs.  
To this end, Series transformers bust be rated for full load current but the magnitude of the injected voltage can be reduced.  
For example, DVR rating in MVA can be determined from the following equation.  
MVADVR is equal to MVA LOAD times Injected Voltage per unit.  
The third device is Universal Power Flow Controller.  
Universal power flow controller is, in fact, combination of a STATCOM and a DVR.  
The main operation principle is as follows.  
Voltage is inserted via coupling transformer on the right-hand side or current injected via coupling inductance on the left-hand side.  
The main components of a UPFC are: Coupling inductance and transformer Two fully controllable converters, DC capacitor.  
A few operational characteristics of distribution universal power flow controllers are listed on this slide.  
The concept is based on unified power flow controller of FACTS.  
which are applied on transmission networks.  
UPFC is a combination of both STATCOM and DVR because it can operate both ways.  
Independent operation of bridges is possible with fast switching of converters.  
And, order of bridges may be reversed to give unified Power Quality Controller.  
The second set of devices for improving voltage profile is shown on this slide.  
These are Constant voltage transformers and ferroresonant transformers.  
Motor-generator sets.  
Superconducting storage devices.  
And Uninterruptable power supply systems.  
The constant voltage transformer, or ferroresonant transformer, has long been used to isolate its sensitive loads from noise sources.  
A CVT also works extremely well to eliminate the impact of voltage sags on sensitive process loads.  
When properly sized, for both steady state loading and load in-rush current requirements, the CVT can eliminate voltage sags to as low as 40% of nominal voltage.  
It should be oversized to at least, 200 of load because in-rush currents of load must be considered in sizing.  
CVT is very good for protection of computers, controls and relays.  
CVT is used for typically up to 3KVA loads.  
The next device is ferroresonant transformers.  
It is a transformer with a 1:1 turns ratio and with a core that is highly magnetised during normal operation.  
There is a secondary resonant winding with a capacitor to produce nearly constant voltage output with varying load.  
Therefore, variation of primary voltage has a much reduced effect on secondary voltage.  
Ferroresonant transformers are good for low constant power loads.  
They do not work well with variable loads especially with high in-rush currents because output voltage collapses.  
They are bulky, noisy, and more costly than conventional transformers.  
The last type of device is static tap switching voltage regulator.  
This is, in fact, traditional tap-changer realised via power electronics.  
It is similar to the series connected active conditioner except voltage boost is provided by tap switching transformer with fast static tap switching.  
A disadvantage is it cannot be configured to control harmonics and transients as the active conditioner can.  
And this completes the presentation of this subsection.  
  
# 3.4 Harmonics, Resonance and Filters   
## 3.4.1 Harmonics: Causes, Sources and Consequences   
LECTURER:   
We are doing module Power Systems Dynamics & Quality Of Supply.  
We have done so far: Introduction to Power Quality, Voltage Variations and Voltage Sags.  
We are continuing to study Power Quality area.  
We are now going to talk about harmonics.  
Harmonics will be studied in this and next presentation.  
In this first presentation, we are going to talk about harmonic causes, sources, and consequences.  
The first area we need to discuss is definition of harmonics with the aid of Fourier analysis.  
We will assume that we have already done Fourier analysis during your previous studies.  
In that respect, this is going to be an overview only.  
The fundamental principle of the Fourier analysis is given in the first bullet point.  
Any continuous function repetitive in an interval T can be represented by the sum of a fundamental sinusoidal component and a series of higher order harmonic components at frequencies which are integral multiples of the fundamental frequency.  
This is the so-called Fourier series.  
We have mentioned harmonic components.  
These are basically sinusoidal functions.  
An example of a function repetitive in an interval T is shown in the figure on this slide.  
This is a periodic function whose mathematical definition is also given on the slides.  
If we apply so-called Fourier transformation, a periodic function can be converted into a Fourier series, or equivalently, time domain signal is converted into frequency domain.  
The first expression shows that a periodic function is equal to a sum of a sinusoidal components and the constant term.  
Parameters an and bn are Coefficients of the Fourier series.  
Fourier series is often expressed in polar coordinates which is given by the second equation.  
The relations connecting the original and vector forms are presented at the bottom of this slide.  
Please note that the fundamental angular frequency is two pi over T and the frequency of F harmonic is two pi over T times n.  
Expressions for the calculation of the Fourier coefficients, A0, AN, and BN, are given on this slide.  
Derivation of these coefficients is relatively simple, and it is being presented because it has been done in your previous studies.  
If you struggle with these expressions, please contact your tutor and additional teaching material will be provided.  
We are now briefly discussing which voltage or current system 3-phase harmonics form.  
The end result will show that in a balanced 3-phase system, individual harmonics are of either positive or negative or zero sequence.  
Let's examine the second harmonic.  
In Phase B, we have two Ω-T minus 240 degrees whereas in Phase C, there is two Ω-T plus 240 degrees.  
This is equivalent to, respectively two Ω-T plus 120 degrees, and two Ω-T minus 120 degrees which clearly indicates that it is a negative sequence system.  
In case of the third harmonic, in phase B, there is three Ω-T minus 360 degrees, and in Phase C, there is three Ω-T plus 360 degrees, which clearly shows that it is a zero sequence system.  
The table at the bottom of the slide shows the sequence system for the first 13 harmonics.  
The next topic to be studied is Causes Of Harmonics.  
The essential cause of harmonics is given on this slide.  
Some load equipment does not draw a sinusoidal current from a perfectly sinusoidal voltage source.  
This happens when the relationship between voltage and current is at every instant of time, is not constant.  
That is, the load is non-linear.  
Then harmonic currents flowing through the system impedance results in harmonic voltages at the loads.  
Harmonic distortion comes from non-linear devices, principally loads.  
Non-linear devices inject harmonic current components into the distribution system.  
A non-linear load can be represented as a source of harmonic currents.  
The constant current source model is valid when the source impedance is significantly smaller than the load impedance.  
This is shown in the button figure on this slide.  
Voltage distortion is the result of the interaction between harmonic currents drawn by the non-linear load and the impedance of the power system itself.  
Voltage distortion can be calculated as the product of the corresponding harmonic current injection and system impedance at that frequency.  
Because of system low impedance, the power system can normally absorb a significant amount of harmonic currents without serious voltage distortion.  
Two examples of harmonic distortion are shown on this slide.  
The first figure presents low order harmonics, most notably the 5th and 7th, when the Total Harmonic Distortion is 24.41%.  
The second figure shows high order harmonics with a 19th and 23rd most pronounced, giving the same Total Harmonic Distortion of 24.41%.  
Please compare the waveforms for the two cases presented.  
We will now presents how harmonic distortion can be quantified.  
We're starting with distorted periodic voltage and current waveforms whose equations are given in the first row.  
This is the general case.  
Active power can be calculated as the average of the products, v from t times i from t.  
We're getting the expression shown in the second row of equations.  
Please note that when the voltage is not distorted, that is, it is an ideal sine wave, then only the fundamental frequency components contributes to the real power.  
The expression for reactive power is shown at the bottom of the slides.  
After having defined active and reactive powers, we need to define the apparent power.  
To this end, we will define the RMS values of the voltage and currents.  
These are given by the equations in the first row.  
Then the apparent power is equal to the product of the RMS values of the voltage and current.  
The major point here is that when there is distortion of the voltage and the current, that additional relationship between apparent power, as active power b and reactive power q, does not hold.  
This is the reason why we have to define a new quantity called distortion power, which makes up the difference between s, p, and q.  
This slide presents the basic characteristic of the active power, apparent power, reactive power, and distortion power.  
We can see that the physical nature of the distortion power is similar to the reactive power.  
This slide presents an example: how to calculate powers for a signal with harmonics.  
Presented calculations make use of the formula shown on the previous slides.  
Please go through them on your own.  
Note that the apparent power is different from the square root from p squared, plus q squared, and that the distortion power is therefore different from zero.  
We're now going to talk about the power factor in case of distorted waveforms.  
A True Power Factor is the ratio of the active power to the apparent power P over S.  
However, when harmonics are present, Power Factor P over S, is different from the Standard Power Factor characterising the fundamental frequency.  
Standard Power Factor is now called Displacement Power Factor.  
It is defined as the ratio of the active power p and apparent power at fundamental frequency S1.  
Now, we need to define Distortion Power Factor, as the ratio of the apparent power at fundamental frequency S1, and the total apparent power S.  
The True Power Factor is then equal to the product of the Displacement Power Factor and the Distortion Power Factor.  
The most frequently used measure of the harmonic distortion is the 'Total Harmonic Distortion' or THD.  
THD is defined for the equation given on these slides.  
Please note that the sum denominator goes over all harmonics starting with the second one, once the denominator is the fundamental frequency harmonic.  
Application of the voltage and the current THD factors is shown on these slides.  
Once the THD factors are assessed or determined, the RMS value of the voltage or currents can be calculated using the RMS value at fundamental frequency and the THD factor.  
This is shown in the second and the fourth equation rows on this slide.  
An example of the calculation of the Total Harmonic Distortion, when both the voltage and current are distorted, is shown on this slide.  
Calculation of THDs is done using the formula given in the previous slides.  
Please go through the calculation on your own.  
A definition of the Total Demand Distortion is presented on this slide.  
We can see that is an analogous to the definition of the Total Harmonic Distortion.  
The only difference can be that in real life, IL is sometimes the total load RMS value.  
We are now going to define current and voltage crest factors that describe peak values, rather than RMS values.  
The definition of the Current Crest Factor - CCF, and Voltage Crest Factor - VCF, is shown in the top-right part of these slides.  
Please note that all quantities are peak values and not RMS values.  
The crest factors are used to express total peak current and voltage values, using the corresponding peaks at fundamental frequency.  
This is given in the second row of equations.  
It is shown, in the last row, that the peak per unit increase, with respect to the first harmonic peak, is equal to the case factor CCF, or case factor VCF.  
In this slide, we have defined the telephone interference factor.  
The reason is that harmonics produce telephone interference through electromagnetic coupling.  
The telephone interference factor is defined by the first equation.  
Note that under the summation in the numerator, there is also fundamental frequency components whilst the IRMS in denominator is the total RMS value.  
The IT product presented in the second equation is directly derived from the telephone interference definition.  
In both equations, Ω-N is the telephone interference waiting factor at the F-harmonic, An example of the calculation of the telephone interference factor, is presented on this slide.  
The calculation is direct application of the TIF formula, presented in the previous slides.  
We will now briefly talk about the harmonic content and harmonic flow.  
The first bullet point addresses harmonic scores, by the three-phase 6 pulse converters.  
We can see that odd-order harmonics are generated starting from the fifth.  
The theoretical and typical real life harmonic content is shown in the table on the right hand side.  
The theoretical content is 100% over N.  
In case of three-phase 12 pulse converters, the first harmonic is the eleventh.  
In case of single-phase converters, the generated harmonics are third, ninth, and fifteenth.  
Note that the order of all harmonics is a multiple of three, which means that they all form zero sequence systems.  
This is discussed in the next slide.  
Harmonics, whose order is a multiple effect of three, are called Triplen harmonics.  
They are all of a zero sequence order.  
The illustration on this slide, shows the flow of the third harmonics in phases A, B, and C, because these harmonics form a zero sequence system.  
They add up in the neutral conductor.  
These can cause a problem, because neutral conductors can be of smaller size compared to the phase conductor.  
The flow of Triplens in transformers is presented on these slides.  
In case of transformer, Grounded Y delta arrangements, Triplens are induced in the secondary windings, but they do not enter the lower voltage network.  
However, in case of Grounded Y arrangements, the Triplens flow in the secondary network.  
The next topic in this presentation is consideration of Harmonic Sources.  
A list of typical harmonic sources is presented on this slide.  
Firstly, this are saturable devices, such as transformers, rotating machines, no-linear reactors.  
Then, arcing devices such as arc furnaces, arc welders, and florescent lightning.  
The third group is power electronics.  
For example, VSD's, DC motor drives, electronic power supplies, rectifiers, inverters, SVCs, and HVDC transmission.  
An example of a harmonic content in commercial buildings, is presented on this slide.  
The content is due to the following equipment: electronic loads, florescent lighting, and variable speed drives.  
We will now present a few sources of harmonics.  
An example of the DC drive current wave form and harmonic content is shown on this slide.  
We can see that the most pronounced harmonic is the 5th.  
The second example shows a drive that is supplied from a converter will be passed with modulation, and without the reactors on the source ends.  
We can see that the old harmonics whose order is five, seven, eleven, and thirteen are very high.  
The total THD is also very high.  
The third example shows so-called switch-mode power supply, because it is switched from AC to DC supply.  
The device consists of a rectifier, and the DC to DC converter are shown in the figure.  
The largest harmonics are the 3rd and the 5th, whilst the 7th harmonic is also significant.  
The last example shows a variable speed drive, that is supplied from power electronics, consisting of a rectifier, DC circuit, and an inverter.  
Pulse with modulation is again used to control the inverter.  
The largest harmonics are the 5th and the 7th.  
THD is also quite high.  
The last topic in this presentation is the Consequences of Harmonics.  
We will discuss the consequences very briefly.  
The major effects of the increased voltage distortion are shown on this slide, and these are: Increased thermal stress.  
Increased transformer magnetic losses, which consist of hysteresis and eddy-current losses.  
Increased dielectric losses.  
Increased motor losses.  
Increased insulation stress, expressed with the increase of peak voltage, that is using voltage crest factor and potential load disruption.  
The final slide in this presentation shows the major concerns when harmonics are present.  
These are: Power factor correction capacitors can cause a parallel or series resonance.  
Motor overheating can be created.  
Transformer overheating and derating requirements can be imposed.  
Various problems with electronic devices may persist.  
High neutral currents can be formed.  
Impact on communication circuits can be exercised.  
Breaker and fuse nuisance tripping can be present.  
There can be flickering of incandescent lighting, and failure of ground fault relaying, due to excessive third harmonic currents.  
And this concludes the presentation of this subsection.  
  
## 3.4.2 Harmonic Resonance and Filters   
LECTURER:   
We are doing module Power System Dynamics and Quality of Supply.  
We should have done so far the following topics.  
Introduction into Power Quality.  
Voltage Variations.  
Voltage sags.  
And Causes, Sources and Consequences of Harmonics.  
This is the last presentation in the Power Quality area.  
In this presentation, we are going to talk about two topics.  
Firstly, about Harmonic Resonance, and secondly, about Harmonic Filters.  
In this slide, we will define resonance first.  
A technical system can have it's own natural frequency, which can be found from the differential equations that describe the system.  
On the other hand, external sources that generate components with different frequencies can be connected to the technical system.  
If the natural network frequency corresponds to one of the characteristic harmonic frequencies of a non-linear load, high distortion can occur.  
This is called resonance.  
The natural network frequency is determined from the condition that the capacitive and inductive reactances are equal.  
This gives the well-known expression for resonance frequency as shown in this slide.  
The resonant frequency fr can also be expressed with reactances instead of inductance and capacitance.  
This is given by the second equation for fr.  
From the second definition of the resonant frequency, we can derive the expression for the harmonic order, or harmonic number at resonant frequency.  
It is simply square root from Xc divided by Xl.  
We will be using harmonic order or harmonic number later on.  
The first type of resonance in distribution networks is parallel resonance.  
One possible circuit configuration is presented on this slide.  
It can be seen when looking from the point of load connection that the reactances Xs and Xc are connected in parallel.  
The expression for the equivalent impedance at the load node is given by the first equation.  
In case system reactance Xs is equal to the capacitive reactance Xc, we are getting very high impedance and very high voltage at resonant frequency.  
We can also define quality factor Q which is equal to the ratio of resistance R and resonant reactance Xr.  
We will use quality factor Q with filters.  
Parallel resonance is graphically shown via the impedance versus harmonic number diagram.  
The equivalent impedance at order point is very high when the harmonic number is equal to the resonant harmonic number.  
This means that the corresponding voltage will also be very high when there is harmonic current injection of the same order.  
Calculation of the parallel resonant frequency denoted as fp is presented on this slide.  
We can see from the first formula that the resonant frequency fp can also be calculated using the network NVA short-circuit capacity Ssc; And the NVA capacity of the capacitor.  
Then the resonant harmonic number hp can also be expressed with the aid of these two quantities.  
Voltage change due to the connection of the capacitor C is derived in the bottom part of the slide.  
We can see that the voltage change can be defined using the resonant harmonic number hp.  
An example of parallel resonance is shown on this slide.  
The diagram presents resonance versus capacitor size for a typical customer supplied with a 1500 KVA 6% transformer.  
The diagram shows that the resonant harmonic number increases when the capacitor NVA rating decreases.  
On the other side, magnification of the harmonic current decreases when there is decrease of the capacitor NVA rating.  
An example of the parallel resonance in real life is shown on this slide.  
A utility capacitor is connected at the 11 KV side of the primary transformer.  
Non-linear loads, which means different harmonic components see network inductive reactance and capacitor reactance connected in parallel.  
This causes magnified harmonic voltage at resonant frequency.  
An example of parallel resonance is presented on this slide.  
It is required to investigate parallel resonance in a network with Xc = 60 ohms and Xs = 0.497 ohms.  
Resonant harmonic number is calculated for us, and it can be seen that it is the 11th harmonic.  
The circuit and capacitor reactance can be calculated at resonant frequency.  
We are getting Xr equal to the square root from Xs times Xc.  
When we replace, hp equals to square root from Xc divided by Xp.  
Finally, resistance R can be determined from the product quality factor Q times reactance Xr for different assumed values of Q.  
The second type of resonance is series resonance.  
Series resonance occurs when there is a series connection of inductance and capacitance at the connection point of the loads.  
This is shown in the figure on this slide.  
In a series RLC circuit, harmonic impedance is calculated from the first equation where n is the order of the harmonic.  
Calculation of the resonance Reactance is shown in the second draw.  
It was assumed that the resonant harmonic number was hs.  
All network resonance in that frequency.  
(INAUDIBLE) impedance z is very small and determined by a resistance R.  
Then the current is substantially magnified and the quality factor q can be defined as the ratio of Xr and resistance R.  
Series resonance is insulated via the diagram harmonic impedance versus harmonic number in this slide.  
It is clear that the harmonic impedance is very small for the resonance harmonic number.  
The impedance increases with the increase in resistance.  
An example of series resonance, in series resonance in real life is shown on the slide.  
Harmonic current components from non linear loads flow through the transformer and parallel factor correction capacitor which causes series resonance.  
Series resonance can also be intentional if a series harmonic filter is used to dampen the harmonic voltages.  
An example of the series resonance is shown on the slides.  
It is asked to investigate series resonance in a network with Xc equals 1.6 ohm and Xs equal to 0.064 ohm.  
Harmonic number hs is calculated first which shows that there is series resonance at the 5th harmonic.  
The resonance reactance is calculated next using the well known formula.  
Finally we can calculate the resistance R from the previously calculated resonance reactance Xr.  
And assume quality factor Q, this is shown in the table on the slides.  
An example of the impact of resistance on parallel resonance is shown on this slide.  
Resisting loads are very effective in damping resonance phenomena.  
On the other hand motor loads have very little influence because of their dominantly inductive nature.  
The major consequence of harmonic resonance are listed on these slides, these are: Capacitor failures, fuse blowing, high voltage distortion can impact other loads for example motor heating and high currents in supply transformers can cause overheating.  
Potential solutions for resonance problems are shown on this slide.  
The first is not to use capacitors for power factor correction.  
This is a widely accepted policy in the UK.  
But in other European countries the power factor capacitors are frequently used.  
The second possibility is the power factor correction capacitors as tuned harmonic filters.  
This means that a capacitor will be selected so as to eliminate harmonics of certain frequencies.  
Another option is to keep parallel resonance frequency above the 8th harmonic.  
We can still have problems at the 11th or 13th harmonic but it is less likely.  
And this concludes our discussion of the network resonances.  
The second topic we are going to discuss now is harmonic filters.  
The main purpose of harmonic filters is to reduce the amplitude of one or more fixed frequency currents or voltages.  
There are two categories of harmonic filters namely shunt and series filters.  
In the case of shunt filters the harmonic currents are prevented from entering the rest of the system by providing a shunt path of low impedance to the harmonic frequencies.  
Shunt filters consist of an inductor and capacitor connected in series.  
On the other hand series filters prevent a harmonic of particular frequency from entering the system.  
Series filters consist of a parallel inductor and capacitor which is a large impedance to the relevant frequency.  
This slide presents a few general characteristics of so called band-pass filters.  
First of all bandpass describes a type of filter and it should be distinguished from the passband which is the actual portion of affected frequency spectrum.  
An ideal bandpass filter has completely flat passband and would completely attenuate all frequencies outside the passband.  
This is shown in the figure on the left hand side.  
Then the bandwidth of an ideal filter is the difference between the upper and lower cut-off frequencies as shown in the left hand side of the figure.  
A real life bandpass filter has the characteristic shown on the right hand side of the slide.  
(INAUDIBLE) ideal filter is presented in the same figure with dotted lines.  
Effective bandwidth of the real life filter can be obtained by dividing the area under the practical filter characteristic by the amplitude to the power of two.  
Effective bandwidth practically it is determined at 50% level or minus three decibel.  
We are now going to talk about the quality of bandpass filters.  
We shall only mention quality factor in relation to parallel and series resonances.  
A bandpass filter can be characterised by its quality factor or q factor.  
The q factor is the reciprocal of the fractional bandwidth.  
Where fractional bandwidth is actual bandwidth divided by the mid point frequency.  
High-q filter has narrow passband where as low q filter has wide passbands.  
Filter quality is in fact defines the sharpness of the tune.  
The high q filter is sharply tuned to one of the lower harmonic frequencies and a typical value of q is between 30 and 60.  
On the other hand for low q filters q is typically in the region of 0.5-5.  
These filters have a low impedance over a wide range of frequencies.  
When used to eliminate the higher order harmonics these are also called high pass filters.  
Quality of high Q filters is Q equals Xr over R, where Xr is resonant reactance.  
Quality of low Q filter is Q equals R over Xr.  
The Q factor determines the qualitative behaviour of damped oscillations.  
There are three main regimes relating damping and the Q factor.  
Overdamped oscillations, the system response will exponentially decay approaching the steady state where you asymptotically.  
As the quality factor is reduced so the systems responds more slowly.  
Underdamped oscillations, as the quality factor increase, the damping falls and oscillations will be sustained for longer.  
In a theoretical system where the Q factor is infinite, the oscillation would be maintained indefinitely without the need for adding any further stimulus.  
And finally, Critically damped oscillations.  
Like an over-damped system, the output does not oscillate, and does not overshoot its steady-state output.  
The system will approach the steady state asymptote in the fastest time.  
We are now going to talk about different types of harmonic filters.  
The first type is series-tuned filters.  
The series-tuned filters consist of a capacitor and a reactor connected in series and tuned to low harmonic frequency.  
It is shown in the figure one the left-hand side.  
The filter impedance depends on the frequency in the following way; It is purely resistive at tuned frequency harmonic.  
It is capacitive for lower harmonics than the tuned.  
And it is inductive for higher harmonics than the tuned.  
The characteristic impedance of (INAUDIBLE) frequency is shown in the figure on the right side.  
Bus pent is denoted with Bp where R is reactance.  
The next type of indices is double tuned filters.  
The name comes from the fact that the filter impedance is low at two tuned frequencies.  
An example of double-tuned filter is shown in figure (b) on the slide.  
The equivalent impedances of two single tuned filters near their resonance frequencies are practically the same as those of a double-tuned filter configuration if impedance equivalencing is done.  
Two single-tuned filters are shown in the figure (a) of the slide.  
The main advantage of double tuned filters is high voltage applications, because of the reduction in the number of inductors to be subjected to full line impulse voltages.  
The next type of filter is damped filters.  
The first, second, and third order damped filters.  
The most commonly used damped filters are second order damped filters.  
An example is presented in the figure on the left-hand side.  
A second order damped filter provides low impedance for wide range of frequencies which is shown in the figure on the right-hand side.  
When damped filters are used to eliminate high order harmonics such as 17th and above they are referred to as high-pass filter.  
The main advantages and these advantages of damped filters are listed in this slide.  
The main advantages are; Its frequency and loading is less sensitive to temperature variation, frequency deviation, or loss of capacitor elements.  
It provides a low impedance for a wide spectrum of harmonics without a need for sub-division of parallel branches with increased switching and maintenance problems.  
Finally, the use of tuned filters often results in parallel resonance between the filter and the system.  
Reactances at a harmonic order which is below the lower tuned filter frequency or in between tuned filter frequencies.  
In such case, this is the use of one or more damped filters is more acceptable.  
The main disadvantages are; To achieve similar level of filtering performance, the damped filter needs to be designed for fundamental VA ratings.  
Good performance can be met within the limits required for power factor correction.  
And the losses in the resistor and reactor are generally higher.  
Yet another category of filters is automatically tuned filters.  
The goal of automatically tuned filters is to reduce maximum frequency deviation from the resonant.  
Automatically tuned filters are tuned by either varying the inductance or automatically switching the capacitors.  
A range of minus plus 5% is usually adequate.  
A control system, which measures the harmonic frequency reactive power in the filter controls the Inductor L and the capacitor C based on the sign and the magnitude of the reactive power.  
Next, advantages of automatically tuned filters over fixed filters are.  
The capacitor rating is low.  
The capacitor can combine a high temperature coefficient of capacitance and a high reactive power rating per unit of volume and per unit of cost.  
And the power loss is smaller because of higher Q factor.  
After having introduced for harmonic filters we are going to say a few words about design of harmonic filters.  
Essential equation used for the design of harmonic filter are presented in this slide.  
Firstly, at the tuned harmonic and inductance is equal to capacitor.  
This gives the reactance and tuned frequency Xn equal to the square root from inductive reactance at two dimensional frequency Xl1 times capacitor reactance at fundamental frequency Xc1.  
The tuned frequency and order are presented in the second low of equations.  
Then the revision it has been done before.  
of individual harmonics are shown by the first part of the first formula of this slide.  
The capacitor voltage can be expressed as the product of harmonic capacitor reactants and current harmonics.  
This is shown by the second part of the first formula.  
The last two equations present reactive power absorber by reactor and delivered by a capacitor.  
It is again possible to use a reactor and capacitor harmonic reactants and current or voltage harmonics.  
Design of series-tuned filters is presented on this slide.  
Series-tuned filter is tuned to the harmonic (h)n.  
The designed steps are listed one by one together with relevant formula.  
Please go through the individual steps on your own.  
An example of the design of series-tuned filter is done on this slide.  
The problem is as follows; A 33kV series-tuned filter has parameters Xc=544.5 ohm, XL= $.5 ohm and R=0.825 ohm.  
What is the tuning order, quality factor, capacitor reactive power and filter MVA size? The solution is presented in the back part of the slide.  
The tuning order is calculated first and it is obtained hn=11.  
The quality factor is calculated next.  
but tuned reactors Xn is square root from Xc times XL and this gives 49.5.  
In the final steps capacitor reactive power and the filter's MVA size are calculated.  
Design of second order damped filters is presented on this slide.  
Second-order damped filter is tuned to the harmonic hn.  
The individual designed steps and corresponding equations are presented one by one.  
Please go through them on your own.  
An example of the design of the second-order damped filter is presented on this slide.  
The problem is as follows; A 33kV, 6.8 MVAr capacitor bank is used as a second-order damped filter tuned to hn >=4.  
Find the elements of the filter.  
The capacitor reactors Xc is calculated first which is followed by the calculation of the inductive reactance XL the tuned reactance Xn.  
Resistance R is determined next for different assumed quality factors Q.  
The filter MVAr is calculated in the final step.  
The last topic discussed in this presentation is power system harmonic studies.  
The first type of studies is harmonic power flow analysis.  
The main steps on the methodology for harmonic power flow analysis are as follows.  
First step, Input resistances, inductances and capacitors of all network elements; input harmonic current injections I nodes(n) at all nodes from for each harmonic n.  
Second step, Build the bus admittance matrix Y bus from n for each harmonic n.  
Third step. Get the impedance matrix Z bus from n equal to inverse of matrix Y bus from (n) for each harmonic n.  
The triangle factorisation of admittance matrix is used for this purpose.  
Fourth step. Find the node voltages as V node from (n) equals Z bus from (n) times I node from (n) for each harmonic n.  
Fifth step. Calculate branch current as I br from (n) equals delta V node divide by diagram matrix [ Z br from (n)] for each harmonic n.  
The final step is calculate voltage and current distortion factors.  
The second type of study are connection studies.  
They are done in utilities on a daily basis.  
The overall process is describing points in the slide.  
When a generator or demand customer is to be connected to a network, it has to comply with power quality standards.  
In the UK the power quality standards are national standards engineering recommendation P28.  
The customer has to provide harmonic current injections I from (n) at the point of connection to the utility.  
The utility performs harmonics analysis and reports back to the customer whether the PQ standards are met or not.  
In case the PQ standards are exceeded, the customer has to provide technical details of the shunt filter that is going to be installed on customer premises.  
These studies are usually done by a third party.  
The utility performs harmonics analysis with either old harmonic current injections I from (n) and proposed filter or with new filtered harmonic current injections I filtered from (n) at the point of connection.  
Methodology for the calculation of harmonics in utilities in relation to connection studies is presented in this slide.  
The methodology go steps are as follows.  
Existing voltage harmonics at the point of connection.  
V point of connection existing from (n) are measured.  
They are often called background harmonics.  
Impedance scan or frequency scan is done using a dedicated software to find the equivalent impedance of the network at the point of connection Z thevanin from (n) for each customer n.  
Voltage harmonics caused by the new customer V point of connection from (n) are calculated for each harmonic (n) for two cases.  
Without and possibly with a harmonic filter.  
Existing V point of connection existing from (n) and new voltage harmonics V point of connection from (n) are added using the rules from engineering recommendation P28.  
Note that this is not straightforward addition.  
And this completes the presentation of this subsection.
